overview of IAM:
Aws service provided in order to manage access to the resources by creating users, groups and roles.

users represent an individual or entities who needs access to aws resources.

Groups are collection of users with similar acccess requirements, making it easier to manage the permissions

roles are used to grant the temporary access to the external entities or services.

Access control and permission defining can be done using policies know as IAM policies in AWS.

IAM policies are written in JSON format specifying actions like allow or deny for specific aws resource.

these polices can be attached to IAM entities to like user, groups, and roles to specify the access for aws resource and services.

It also provide multifactor authentication, and audit trails for checking the user activity and chages to permissions.

AWS IAM ensures effective management and secure access to the aws resources by allowing only authorized users have appropriate permissions.

it also ensures accountability and compliance by logging the actions
